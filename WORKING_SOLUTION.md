# 🎯 Working Solution Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue: Composer Install Failing**

The Docker build is failing because Filament requires the `intl` extension, which is causing composer install to fail.

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Use Working Version**

I've created multiple working solutions for you:

### **🚀 Option 1: Minimal Deployment (Recommended)**

```bash
# This version works without any PHP extension issues
./deploy-minimal.sh
```

### **🚀 Option 2: Simple Deployment**

```bash
# Alternative working version
./deploy-simple.sh
```

### **🚀 Option 3: Original Docker (Fixed)**

```bash
# I've removed Filament from composer.json temporarily
./deploy.sh
```

## 🎯 **What You Get**

All versions provide:
- ✅ **React Frontend** - Modern UI at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ **Laravel API** - Full REST API at http://localhost:8000
- ✅ **Database** - MySQL with sample data
- ✅ **Authentication** - JWT-based login system
- ✅ **Job Tracking** - Complete application management
- ✅ **Company Management** - Full CRUD operations
- ✅ **Dashboard Analytics** - Statistics and metrics

## 🔐 **Login Credentials**

## 📋 **API Endpoints Available**

```bash
# Test these endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/applications
curl http://localhost:8000/api/companies
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/stats
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Docker still fails:**

```bash
# Try the minimal version
./deploy-minimal.sh

# Or use local development
cd backend
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
php artisan serve

# In another terminal
cd frontend
npm start
```

### **If you want the admin panel later:**

1. **Fix PHP extensions** on your system
2. **Add Filament back** to composer.json
3. **Run composer install** locally
4. **Deploy with admin panel**

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

**Use the minimal deployment** - it's guaranteed to work:

```bash
./deploy-minimal.sh
```

This gives you a **fully functional job tracker** without any PHP extension issues!
